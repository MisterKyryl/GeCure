							Actinomycetes, especially those within the genus Streptomyces, are unparalleled in their ability to produce antibiotics. This
							group is responsible for the discovery of over two-thirds of naturally derived antibiotics which are staples in clinical
							treatments against bacterial infections. Actinomycetes inhabit soil and decomposing organic matter, environments ripe with
							microbial competition, prompting these organisms to evolve chemical defenses in the form of secondary metabolites. Their
							metabolic repertoire extends beyond antibiotics to include antifungals, antiparasitic agents, immunosuppressants, and anticancer
							compounds, making them a cornerstone in the development of new pharmaceuticals.

							treating infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria, underscoring their role in combating antibiotic resistance.
							Furthermore, bacilli are a source of industrially relevant enzymes and biopesticides, demonstrating their versatility and utility
							beyond pharmaceutical applications. Last bot not the least, members of Bacillota phylum carry genes for an untapped variety of
							CRISPR-associated enzymes (e.g. Cas9).

						<p class="biosynthetic__text">
							Secondary metabolites are complex organic compounds synthesized via cascades of enzymatic reactions inside bacterial cell. One of
							the most important discoveries of last century is understanding, that enzymes for the biosynthesis of bacterial secondary
							metabolites are encoded within so-called biosynthetic gene clusters. These are assemblies of genes, which are i) co-localized on
							a chromosome; ii) co-expressed; and iii) co-regulated. Advanced tools of computer analysis allow to scan bacterial genomes in

									natural sources were discovered. Everyone knows about the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Flemming, however “golden

									antibiotics started when Selman Waksman pointed on actinomycetes – mycelium-forming soil-dwelling Gram-positive bacteria –

							</h5>
							<p class="header-body-main-targets__text">
								The bacterial cell wall is a rigid, mesh-like structure composed of peptidoglycan molecules. It is vital for maintaining cell
								shape and integrity, provides turgor, serves as a protective shell, and acts as a semi-permeable barrier. Animal cells lack a
								cell wall, making it an ideal target for antibiotics. Furthermore, the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and cell wall assembly is
								a complex process involving numerous enzymes and precursor molecules. With so many targets, multiple groups of antibiotics can
								terminate or inhibit cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Currently, there are two groups of
								antibiotics targeting cell wall biosynthesis that are used in humans: β-lactam and glycopeptide antibiotics. The first group
								is best known for its founding member, penicillin, although hundreds of natural and semi-synthetic β-lactams are known today,
								with many used in clinical practice. Meanwhile, the best-known glycopeptides are vancomycin and teicoplanin, which are used to
								treat serious infections in both infants and adults.

											The bacterial ribosome has a different structure than the ribosome of eukaryotes (including humans and other

											Clinically-used antibiotics that target protein biosynthesis in bacteria include aminoglycosides, tetracyclines,
											amphenicols, macrolides, and lincosamides.

							Antifungal secondary metabolites from bacteria
						</h3>
						<p class="body-antifungal__text">
							Different species of fungi can cause acute or opportunistic infections in humans. Fungal infections are often difficult to
							diagnose due to their subtle manifestations in the early stages, while treatment at later stages requires the use of various
							classes of antifungal compounds. <br> The leading class of antifungal compounds is the polyenes, secondary metabolites produced
							by
							actinomycetes. The founding member of the polyene antifungals, amphotericin B, was isolated from Streptomyces nodosus in 1955,
							entered clinical use in 1958, and remains widely utilized. Amphotericin B and other polyenes bind to ergosterol, an integral
							component of the fungal cell membrane. This binding induces pore formation, leading to ion leakage and subsequent cell death.
							<br> Resistance to polyenes is relatively rare; however, the spread of resistant Aspergillus and Candida spp. has increased in
							recent
							years. Especially alarming is the spread of multidrug resistant strains of Candida auris. Fortunately, actinomycetes, especially
							Streptomyces spp., are prolific sources of polyenes. The continuous search for novel polyene antifungals is essential for
							tackling fungal resistance.

											occasionally hemoptysis. The pathology often involves angioinvasion, where the fungus invades blood vessels, leading
											to thrombosis and infarction of lung tissue. Diagnostic approaches include imaging, notably chest CT scans showing
											characteristic 'halo' signs, direct microscopic examination of sputum, and culture of the organism. Treatment
											typically involves antifungal agents like voriconazole or amphotericin B. Given the high mortality associated with
											invasive aspergillosis, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.

						Anticancer compounds from bacterial sources

					<div class="anticancer__body">
						<p class="anticancer__text">
							Bacteria are able to produce different secondary metabolites that are cytotoxic. Term “cytotoxic” means that a certain compound
							is able to kill eukaryotic cells in vitro and in vivo, inducing either necrosis or apoptosis. However, it is important that
							certain compounds should have higher affinity to cancer cells, also having antiproliferative (i.e. suppressing the growth of
							malignant cells into surrounding tissue) and antineoplastic (i.e. suppressing or preventing the formation of tumor) properties in
							vivo.
						</p>
						<p class="anticancer__text">
							Several groups of bacterial secondary metabolites have demonstrated such properties and are investigated as a promising treatment
							options for different types of cancer. However, as of today, only one group of such compounds are actively used in clinics. These
							are antracyclines, actinomycin, and bleomycin. All these compounds are able to interfere with DNA, affecting rapidly growing
							cells and hence having higher affinity for actively dividing malignant cells.

								1) Anthracyclines
							</h3>
							<p class="item-anthracyclines__text">
								Anthracyclines are a class of potent anticancer drugs widely used in chemotherapy regimens for a variety of cancers, including
								leukemias, lymphomas, breast cancer, and sarcomas. Anthracyclines are produced by different Streptomyces spp., and the most
								notable members of this class include doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, and epirubicin. These compounds are known for
								their ability to intercalate into DNA, disrupting the function of topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA replication and
								transcription. This disruption leads to the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.
							</p>
							<p class="item-anthracyclines__text">
								Anthracyclines are also known for generating free radicals, which contribute further to their cytotoxic effects by damaging
								cellular membranes, DNA, and proteins. However, their clinical use is often limited by a significant side effect:
								cardiotoxicity, which can lead to long-term heart damage. Despite this, anthracyclines remain a cornerstone of cancer therapy
								due to their efficacy, and ongoing research aims to develop derivatives with reduced cardiotoxic effects and improved
								cancer-targeting abilities.

							<h3 class="item-anthracyclines__title title">
								2) Actinomycin D, also known as dactinomycin
							</h3>
							<p class="item-anthracyclines__text">
								Actinomycin D, also known as dactinomycin, is a chemotherapy drug used primarily in the treatment of various cancers,
								including Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and certain types of ovarian and testicular cancers. This compound
								is derived from the bacterium Streptomyces parvulus and was one of the first secondary metabolites shown to have anticancer
								activity.
							</p>
							<p class="item-anthracyclines__text">
								Actinomycin D exerts its anticancer effects by intercalating into DNA, where it preferentially binds to guanine residues and
								inhibits the transcription process by blocking the elongation phase by RNA polymerase. This inhibition prevents the synthesis
								of mRNA and subsequently protein synthesis, leading to cell death. <br> Despite its effectiveness, the use of actinomycin D is
								limited by its toxicity, which can include severe effects on the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow suppression, and effects
								on the liver and kidneys. Its use is typically reserved for specific types of cancer where it has been shown to improve
								survival outcomes, often as part of a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen.

						<div class="anthracyclines__item item-anthracyclines item-anthracyclines_03">
							<h3 class="item-anthracyclines__title title">
								3) Bleomycins
							</h3>
							<p class="item-anthracyclines__text">
								Bleomycins serve as effective anticancer agents. These drugs are primarily used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's
								lymphoma, testicular cancer, and certain types of head and neck cancers. Bleomycins are derived from the bacterium
								Streptomyces verticillus and bind to DNA causing strand breaks through oxidative damage. This leads to cell cycle arrest and
								apoptosis in cancer cells.
							</p>
							<p class="item-anthracyclines__text">
								Bleomycins are administered via intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous routes, allowing for flexible dosing in clinical
								settings. One of the notable advantages of bleomycins is their minimal myelosuppressive effects, making them a preferred
								option in combination chemotherapy regimens where bone marrow preservation is crucial. <br> However, bleomycin usage is
								significantly limited by its potential to cause pulmonary toxicity, which can manifest as pulmonary fibrosis, particularly
								with higher cumulative doses. This side effect necessitates careful monitoring of lung function during treatment.
